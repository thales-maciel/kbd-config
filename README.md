# Keyboard Config

This is my journey to develop a layout that works specifically for me.

## Rationale

- I spend a lot of my time typing, so health/comfort matters;
- I type in english and portuguese (mostly english, but I need to switch fast several times in the day);
- I spend most of my type coding, so I have some specific needs regarding symbols;
